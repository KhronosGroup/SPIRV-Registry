Dependencies
------------

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.3, Revision 2, Unified.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

Overview
--------

This extension provides SPIR-V support for the GLSL *GL_NV_shading_rate_image*
extension.

In the corresponding API extensions, applications can use a texture
to control the number of fragment shader invocations that will be spawned
for a particular neighborhood of covered pixels. We refer to the density
of fragment shader invocations as the "shading rate".

This extension adds support for two new fragment shader built-ins under the
new *ShadingRateNV* capability. These built-ins can be used to determine
the shading rate used when executing the fragment shader.

A *FragmentSizeNV* decorated variable will represent the size of a rectangle
of pixels that is being shaded by this fragment shader invocation.

A *InvocationsPerPixelNV* decorated variable will represent the maximum number
of fragment shader invocations executed for each pixel.

Extension Name
--------------

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following
*OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_NV_shading_rate"
----

Validation Rules
----------------

An OpExtension must be added to the SPIR-V for validation layers to check
legal use of this extension:

----
OpExtension "SPV_NV_shading_rate"
----


Issues
------

. What are we going to do for interactions with ARB_fragment_shader_interlock?
  We don't yet have a SPV extension for that.
+
--
*RESOLVED*: Deferred to be added in an interaction with a future SPV/Vulkan
extension that adds support for pixel and sample exclusive access modes.
When this extension is supported, a third 'shading rate' exclusive access mode
will be needed.
--

. How should we name the built-in variable describing the number of pixels
  covered by a given fragment?
+
--
*RESOLVED*: We are using *FragmentSizeNV* to mirror the "gl_FragmentSizeNV"
GLSL builtin from GL_NV_shading_rate_image. In retrospect it might have
been more consistent with existing naming conventions to call it *FragSizeNV*
instead. There are a number of other built-ins that have "Frag" in the name
(FragCoord, FragDepth, and FragStencilRefEXT), but none that have Fragment.
A future extension which promotes this functionality may wish to rename it as
as alias.
--

. Why is the SPIR-V extension named NV_shading_rate (without "image") but
  the Vulkan API and GLSL extensions are called NV_shading_rate_image?
+
--
*RESOLVED*:
The API extensions add the "shading rate image" to control the fragment
shading rate, however the GLSL/SPV only add builtins, so it is strange to
include "image" in the name. Unfortunately the GLSL portion was already
baked so it didn't get the chance to drop the "_image" in time.
