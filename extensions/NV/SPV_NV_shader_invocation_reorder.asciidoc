This extension is written against the Unified SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.6, Revision 1.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.4.

This extension requires SPV_KHR_ray_tracing.

This extension requires SPV_EXT_physical_storage_buffer, SPV_KHR_physical_storage_buffer
or SPIR-V 1.5.

This extension interacts with SPV_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur.

Overview
--------

This extension adds hit objects and reordering builtins to provide finer
grain control over traversal during ray tracing.

Validation Rules
----------------

An OpExtension must be added to the SPIR-V for validation layers to check
legal use of this extension:

----
OpExtension "SPV_NV_shader_invocation_reorder"
----

Interactions with SPV_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur
------------------------------------------------

If the 'SPV_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur' extension is not supported, the
*OpHitObjectTraceRayMotionNV*, *OpHitObjectRecordHitMotionNV*,
*OpHitObjectRecordHitWithIndexMotionNV*, and *OpHitObjectRecordMissMotionNV*
instructions are not supported.
