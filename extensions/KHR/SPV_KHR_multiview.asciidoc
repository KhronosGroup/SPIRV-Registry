Dependencies
------------

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.1 Revision 4.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

Overview
--------

This extension adds a new capability to support the Vulkan
VK_KHX_multiview extension in SPIR-V.

The new *MultiView* capability allows the *ViewIndex* builtin
variable to be exported from all shaders stages except compute,
which represents the index of view currently being rendered to.

Extension Name
--------------

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following
*OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_KHR_multiview"
----

New Capabilities
----------------

This extension introduces a new capability:

----
MultiView
----

New Builtins
------------

A new builtin is added as an input for all shader stages except compute.

----
ViewIndex
----

Input view index of the view currently being rendered to.

New Instructions
----------------

None.
