*3.RF, Ray Flags*

Flags controlling the properties of an *{instruction}* instruction
or for comparing against the *IncomingRayFlagsKHR* builtin.
See the client API specification for more details.

Despite being a mask and allowing multiple bits to be combined,
the following combinations are invalid:

  * if more than one of these four bits are set:
    *OpaqueKHR*, *NoOpaqueKHR*, *CullOpaqueKHR*, *CullNoOpaqueKHR*.
  * if more than one of these three bits are set: *SkipTrianglesKHR*,
    *CullBackFacingTrianglesKHR*, *CullFrontFacingTrianglesKHR*.
  * if more than one of these two bits are set: *SkipTrianglesKHR*,
    *SkipAABBsKHR*.
