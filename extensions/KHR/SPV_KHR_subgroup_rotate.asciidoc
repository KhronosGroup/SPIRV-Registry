Dependencies
------------

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification Version 1.5 Revision 5.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.3.

Overview
--------

This extension adds a new instruction that enables rotating values across invocations
within a subgroup. Taking the example of a subgroup of size 16, a rotation by an
amount of 2 would, when executed by the invocation identified by id 0, return the value
from the invocation identified by the id 2. The same rotation instruction, when
executed by the invocation identified by id 14, would return the value from the
invocation identified by id 0.

A rotation by an amount of N rotates values "down" N invocations within the subgroup.

A rotation by an amount of (SubgroupSize - N) rotates values "up" N invocations
within the subgroup.

Extension Name
--------------

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following
*OpExtension* must be present in the module:

Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify Section 3.31, "Capability", adding these rows to the Capability table:

--
[options="header"]

2+^| Capability ^| Implicitly declares
| 6026 | *GroupNonUniformRotateKHR* +
Use *OpGroupNonUniformRotateKHR* instruction | *GroupNonUniform*
|====

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the new instruction:

[cols="1,1,6*3",width="100%"]
|=====
6+|[[OpGroupNonUniformRotateKHR]]*OpGroupNonUniformRotateKHR* +
 +
Return the 'Value' of the <<Invocation,invocation>> whose id within the group is
calculated as follows: +
 +
LocalId = *SubgroupLocalInvocationId* if 'Execution' is *Subgroup* or *LocalInvocationId* if 'Execution' is *Workgroup* +
RotationGroupSize = 'ClusterSize' when 'ClusterSize' is present, otherwise +
RotationGroupSize = *SubgroupMaxSize* if the *Kernel* capability is declared and *SubgroupSize* if not. +
Invocation ID = ( (LocalId + 'Delta') & (RotationGroupSize - 1) ) + (LocalId & ~(RotationGroupSize - 1)) +
 +
'Result Type'  must be a scalar or vector of <<Floating,'floating-point type'>>,
<<Integer,'integer type'>>, or <<Boolean,'Boolean type'>>.  +
 +
'Execution' is a <<Scope_-id-, 'Scope'>>. It must be either *Workgroup* or *Subgroup*. +
 +
 The type of 'Value' must be the same as 'Result Type'.  +
 +
'Delta'  must be a scalar of <<Integer,'integer type'>>, whose 'Signedness' operand is 0.  +
'Delta' must be _dynamically uniform_ within 'Execution'. +
 +
'Delta' is treated as unsigned and the resulting value is undefined if the selected lane is inactive. +
 +
'ClusterSize' is the size of cluster to use. 'ClusterSize' must be a scalar
of integer type, whose 'Signedness' operand is 0. 'ClusterSize' must
come from a constant instruction. Behavior is undefined unless
'ClusterSize' is at least 1 and a power of 2. If 'ClusterSize' is greater
than the declared *SubGroupSize*, executing this instruction results
in undefined behavior.
2+|<<Capability,Capability>>: +
*GroupNonUniformRotateKHR*
