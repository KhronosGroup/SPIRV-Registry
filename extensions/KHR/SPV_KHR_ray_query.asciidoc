Validation Rules
----------------

An OpExtension must be added to the SPIR-V for validation layers to check
legal use of this extension:

----
OpExtension "SPV_KHR_ray_query"
----

Interactions with SPV_KHR_ray_tracing
-------------------------------------

*OpTypeAccelerationStructureKHR*, *RayTraversalPrimitiveCullingKHR*,
*OpConvertUToAccelerationStructureKHR* and the `Ray Flags` are added by both
this extension and `SPV_KHR_ray_tracing`; they
are intended to have identical definitions, and can be enabled by either
extension's capability, for use with the instructions under that same
capability.
If `SPV_KHR_ray_tracing` is not supported, ignore any references to
*OpTraceRayKHR*.


Issues
------

1) What are the differences between provisional and final?

Discussion:

  * rename OpTypeRayQueryProvisionalKHR to OpTypeRayQueryKHR as was originally
    intended. Seems like it fell victim to an overreaching seach and replace
    when this was made provisional.
  * change RayQueryProvisionalKHR to RayQueryKHR and assign new
    token (4472)
  * add OpConvertUToAccelerationStructureKHR (4447) instruction to convert
    64-bit integer to OpTypeAccelerationStructureKHR to enable query by handle
