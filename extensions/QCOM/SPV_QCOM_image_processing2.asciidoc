Dependencies
------------

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.6 Revision 3.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.4.

Overview
--------

This extension introduces a new set of operations for image processing, along with
a new capability and a new decoration.

Extension Name
--------------

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following
*OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_QCOM_image_processing2"
----

New Capabilities
----------------

This extension introduces a new capability:

----
TextureBlockMatch2QCOM
----

New Decorations
---------------

The extension adds a new sampler decoration.

----
BlockMatchSamplerQCOM
----

New Instructions
----------------

Instructions added under the *TextureBlockMatch2QCOM* capability:

----
OpImageBlockMatchWindowSADQCOM
OpImageBlockMatchWindowSSDQCOM
OpImageBlockMatchGatherSADQCOM

Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.6
------------------------------------------------------
Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify Section 3.31, "Capability", adding the following row to the Capability table:

--
[options="header"]
|====
2+^| Capability ^| Implicitly declares
| 4498 | *TextureBlockMatch2QCOM* +
Add texture block match2 operations. This capability is required to use any of the 
OpImageBlockMatchWindow* or OpImageBlockMatchGather* instructions.|
|====
--

Decorations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify Section 3.20, "Decoration", adding the following row to the Decoration table:

--
[options="header"]
|====
2+^| Decoration 2+^| Extra Operands	^| Enabling Capabilities
| 4499 | *BlockMatchSamplerQCOM* +
Apply to samplers used to create Target Sampled Image and Reference Sampled Image in 
OpImageBlockMatchWindowSSDQCOM or OpImageBlockMatchWindowSADQCOM.  Behavior is defined by the runtime environment.
2+| | *TextureBlockMatch2QCOM*
|====

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify Section 3.49.10, "Image Instructions", adding before OpImageSampleFootprintNV:

Validation Rules
----------------

An OpExtension must be added to the SPIR-V for validation layers to check
legal use of this extension:

An object decorated with BlockMatchSamplerQCOM must be used only with the 
corresponding built-in functions. Such an object must not be used with any other functions.
