== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.6 Revision 2.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

== Overview

This extension introduces two new storage classes that are sub classes of the CrossWorkgroup storage class.  
Using these more specific storage classes provides additional information that can enable optimization. 
The extension also introduces two new conversion instructions to enable converting pointers from and to these storage classes.  

== Extension Name
To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following *OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_INTEL_usm_storage_classes"
----

== New capabilities
This extension introduces a new capability:

----
USMStorageClassesINTEL
----

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.6 Revision 2

=== Storage Class

Modify Section 3.7, Storage Class, adding these rows to the table:

--
[options="header"]
|===
2+^| Storage Class | Enabling Capabilities
| 5936 | *DeviceOnlyINTEL* +
A subset of the *CrossWorkgroup* storage class.  Memory that is resident on the device.  SYCL or OpenCL device unified shared memory. | *USMStorageClassesINTEL*
| 5937 | *HostOnlyINTEL* +
A subset of the *CrossWorkgroup* storage class.  Memory that is resident on the host.  SYCL or OpenCL host unified shared memory. | *USMStorageClassesINTEL*
|===
--

=== Capability

Modify Section 3.31, Capability, adding a row to the Capability table:
--
[options="header"]
|====
2+^| Capability ^| Implicitly Declares
| 5935 | *USMStorageClassesINTEL* | *Kernel*
|====
--

=== Instructions

Modify Section 3.36.11, Conversion Instructions, adding two new instructions as follows:

[cols="1,1,3*3",width="100%"]
|===
4+| *OpPtrCastToCrossWorkgroupINTEL*

Converts a pointer's Storage Class from a more specific class to *CrossWorkgroup*.

_Result Type_ must be an OpTypePointer.  Its Storage Class must be *CrossWorkgroup*.  

_Pointer_ must point to the *DeviceOnlyINTEL* or *HostOnlyINTEL* Storage Class.  

_Pointer_ must have the same type as _Result Type_ aside from the Storage Class. 1+| Capability: +
*USMStorageClassesINTEL*
| 4 | 5934 | <id> +
Result Type | Result <id> | <id> +
Pointer

4+| *OpCrossWorkgroupCastToPtrINTEL*

Convert a pointer's Storage Class from *CrossWorkgroup* to a more specific class.

_Result Type_ must be an OpTypePointer.  _Result Type_'s Storage Class must be *DeviceOnlyINTEL* or *HostOnlyINTEL*.

_Pointer_ must point to the *CrossWorkgroup* Storage Class.

_Pointer_ must have the same type as _Result Type_ aside from the Storage Class.  1+| Capability: +
*USMStorageClassesINTEL*
| 4 | 5938 | <id> +
Result Type | Result <id> | <id> +
