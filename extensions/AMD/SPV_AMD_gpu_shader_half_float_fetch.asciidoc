Version
-------

Modified Date: February 2, 2018
Revision:      1

Dependencies
------------

This extension is written against Revision 2 of the version 1.2 of the
SPIR-V Specification.

The extension is written against Revision 5 of the OpenGL extension
AMD_gpu_shader_half_float_fetch.

Overview
--------

This extension is written to provide the functionality of the
AMD_gpu_shader_half_float_fetch, OpenGL Shading Language Specification extension,
for SPIR-V.

This extension introduces 16-bit sampled type support to image instructions.

This extension introduces support for 16-bit floating-poing type which can now
be used as a coordinate and a result texel type.

Extension Name
--------------

To enable SPV_AMD_gpu_shader_half_float_fetch extension in SPIR-V, use

  OpExtension "SPV_AMD_gpu_shader_half_float_fetch"

Summary
-------

This extension adds a new *Float16ImageAMD* capability.

This extension adds support for 16-bit float 'Result Type' which can now be used by the following image instructions:

----
