== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.5 Revision 5.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

== Overview

This extension adds the *EarlyAndLateFragmentTestsAMD* *Execution*
*Mode*, which enables both early and late fragment tests in some circumstances.

Additionally, it adds execution modes describing how the shader stencil
value is written, allowing stencil writes to be used with this new mode.


== Extension Name

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following *OpExtension* must
be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_AMD_shader_early_and_late_fragment_tests"
----

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.5

=== Capabilities

Modify Section 3.6, "Execution Mode", adding the following row to the table:

Fragment tests can be performed both before and after fragment shader execution, with latter tests taking values written to _FragDepth_ and _FragStencilRefEXT_ into account. Early tests are not guaranteed, late tests are.+
 +
If neither of *ExecutionModeDepthReplacing* or *ExecutionModeStencilRefReplacingEXT* are specified, functions identically to *EarlyFragmentTests*. +
If this and *ExecutionModeStencilRefReplacingEXT* are both specified, one of *StencilRefGreaterAMD*, *StencilRefLessAMD*, or *StencilRefUnchangedAMD* must also be specified. +
If this and *ExecutionModeDepthReplacing* are both specified, one of *DepthGreater*, *DepthLess*, or *DepthUnchanged* must also be specified. +

Indicates that early per-fragment tests may assume that any _FragStencilRefEXT_ built in-decorated value written by the shader is equal to the stencil reference value set for the front face in the client API after masking.
Late per-fragment tests will use the written value as normal. +
