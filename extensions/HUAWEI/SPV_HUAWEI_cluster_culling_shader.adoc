Dependencies
This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.6

== Overview
This extensions provides SPIR-V support for the *GLSL GL_HUAWEI_cluster_culling_shader* extension which adds a new programmable shader types - cluster culling shaders - that has an execution environment similar to that of compute shaders. The developer can use this new shader to perform coarse-level geometry culling on GPU and direct emit visible cluster with a shading rate to the subsequent rendering pipeline.

== Extension Name
To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following *OpExtension* must be present in the module
----
OpExtension "SPV_HUAWEI_cluster_culling_shader"
----

== New Capabilities

This extension introduces new capabilities:
----
ClusterCullingShadingHUAWEI
----
