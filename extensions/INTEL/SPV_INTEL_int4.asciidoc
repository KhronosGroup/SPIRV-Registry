== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.6 Revision 3.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

This extension interacts with SPV_KHR_cooperative_matrix.

== Overview

Implementations may support small types that are not naturally aligned to the granularity of the implementation's memory addressing.
These types can sometimes still be supported for some operations, but require conversion or packing into larger types to load or store data in memory.
This extension adds a new capability to declare a 4-bit integer type, and capabilities to allow this type to be used in cooperative matrices.
4-bit integer types can be declared in external memory only as part of a larger type that is aligned to a supported size.

== Extension Name

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following
*OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_INTEL_int4"
----

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.6

=== Capabilities

Modify Section 3.31, Capability, adding this row to the table:

--
[cols="^.^2,16,15",options="header",width = "100%"]
|====
2+^.^| Capability | Implicitly Declares
| 5112 | *Int4TypeINTEL* +
Uses *OpTypeInt* to specify integer types with a 'Width' of 4 and the use of conversion functions for those types.
|
| 5114 | *Int4CooperativeMatrixINTEL* +
Uses cooperative matrices with a *Component Type* of *OpTypeInt* with a 'Width' of 4.
| *Int4TypeINTEL*, *CooperativeMatrixKHR* +
 +

=== Memory Layout

Add to Section 2.18.1. Memory Layout, Int 4 layout:

Scalar integer variables with a `Width` of 4 can only be declared in the `Private` or `Function` storage classes.
In other storage classes, they must be included in an `OpTypeVector` with an even `Component Count`, where the first component in every pair is in bits 0-3 of the corresponding byte, and the second component is in bits 4-7.

=== Validation Rules

Add the following bullets to section 2.16.1, Universal Validation Rules:

  * If *Int4TypeINTEL* is declared then the 'Width' operand of *OpTypeInt* may be 4.
  * If *Int4CooperativeMatrixINTEL* is declared then the 'Component Type' operand of *OpTypeCooperativeMatrixKHR* may be an *OpTypeInt* with a 'Width' of 4.
  * Types that are or include an integer type with a 'Width' of 4, or <<Object,objects>> with such a type, must only be used with the following instructions:
