== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.4 Revision 1.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

== Overview

This extension adds an instruction which explicitly requests that a pipelining register be introduced at a particular point in a program (on a specific assignment).  The instruction is useful for FPGA targets, to separate regions of the program that are expected to end up in geographically distant regions of a device.  This instruction is purely an optimization hint, and is functionally equivalent to an assignment.

== Extension Name
To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following *OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_INTEL_fpga_reg"
----
 
== New capabilities
This extension introduces a new capability:

----
FPGARegINTEL
----

== New Instructions

Instructions added under the *FPGARegINTEL* capability:

----
OpFPGARegINTEL
----

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.4

=== Capability

Modify Section 3.31, Capability, adding a row to the Capability table:

=== Instructions
In section 3.32.1, Miscellaneous Instructions, add a new instruction, *OpFPGARegINTEL*, as follows:
[cols="5", width="100%"]
|=====
4+^|*OpFPGARegINTEL* +

Used to indicate to FPGA backends that pipelining registers should be inserted between the definition of _Input_ and uses of _Result_.  The value passed in as _Input_ is returned in _Result_. This instruction is strictly an optimization hint and thus it would be functionally correct for a consumer to treat it as an assignment.  

_Result Type_ can be any type and is the type of both _Result_ and _Input_.
