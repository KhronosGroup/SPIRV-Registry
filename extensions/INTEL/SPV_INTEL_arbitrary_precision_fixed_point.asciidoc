== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification Version 1.6, Revision 2.

While this extension does not require SPV_INTEL_arbitrary_precision_integers, the new operators it adds are significantly more useful when that extension is supported as the combination of the two extensions allows for more freedom in the width of arbitrary precision data types that can be represented (see the definition of the `W` parameter below).  

This extension is built on Mentor Graphics ac_datatypes spec v3.9.2.

== Overview

This extension introduces operations for arbitrary precision fixed point numbers called ac_fixed.
The ac_fixed datatype is an industry standard for fixed point numbers and is published by Mentor Graphics at https://hlslibs.org[hlslibs.org].
This datatype and its corresponding operations can be useful on targets that can take advantage of narrower representation such as FPGAs.

=== Data Representation

The ac_fixed datatype will be represented in SPIR-V as a _pseudo type_ using *OpTypeInt*.
It is characterized by three parameters: `W`, `I`, and `S`.

* `W` is the total width of the datatype (including a sign bit, if required) and is encoded in the width of the *OpTypeInt*.
* `I` determines the position of the decimal point.
** When `I` >= 0, `I` bits starting from the MSB of `W` are before the decimal point. If `I` is greater than `W`, then additional 0 bits are implied after the bits of `W` and before the decimal point.
** When `I` < 0, `-I` 0 bits are implied after the decimal point and before the MSB of `W`.
* `S` determines if this is a signed or an unsigned number. Note that the support for signedness in *OpTypeInt* is not leveraged here. If the ac_fixed is signed, then the MSB (most significant bit) will contain the sign bit.

The datatype itself does not contain any information regarding `I` and `S`.
Each operation will contain information about the input and result datatypes (including `W`, `S`, and `I`) where `W` is implicit from the size of the *OpTypeInt*.

A variable of ac_fixed type can contain both an integer component and a fractional component depending on the value of `I`.
Based on its value, the number of bits allocated for the integer and fractional portions will change.
Note that it is also possible that one of the two portions may have no bits.

=== Overflow Modes

For signed: a positive overflow will saturate at the maximum positive value, whereas a negative overflow will saturate to the negation of the maximum positive value, as opposed to the most negative value.                               | *ArbitraryPrecisionFixedPointINTEL*
