== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification Version 1.6, Revision 2.

While this extension does not require SPV_INTEL_arbitrary_precision_integers, the new operators it adds are significantly more useful when that extension is supported as the combination of the two extensions allows for more freedom in the width of arbitrary precision floating point data types that can be represented.

== Overview

This extension adds instructions for performing arbitrary precision floating point computations. Each arbitrary-precision floating point value is represented as an *OpTypeInt* as described below.
This datatype and its corresponding operations can be useful on targets that can take advantage of narrower representation such as FPGAs.

The datatype can be characterized by two parameters:

* _E_: the number of exponent bits
* _M_: the number of mantissa bits

The total width of the *OpTypeInt* container is `E+M+1` where the extra bit is used to represent the sign.
Note that the signedness capabilities of *OpTypeInt* are not used for any of the operations.
The data layout is shown below:

`[ S (sign bit) ][ E (Exponent) ][ M (Mantissa) ]  
^--MSB                                    LSB--^`

The width of the data `(E+M+1)` is encoded with the width of the *OpTypeInt*.
The other parameters regarding the type (namely `E` and `M`) are encoded in the arguments of the operations.

=== Operation Controls

Each of the operations will also provide some control over the _Rounding Mode_ and the _Subnormal support_.

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification Version 1.6

After Section 3.16, add a new section "3.16a Subnormal Support" as follows:

=== Subnormal Support

Control whether subnormal support is enabled or not.

[options="header"]
[width="60%"]
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====
| Value ^| Subnormal Support
| 0 | Flush subnormal numbers to zero on inputs and outputs
| 1 | Enable support for operating on subnormal numbers
|====

After Section 3.16, add a new section "3.16d Rounding Accuracy" as follows:

=== Rounding Accuracy

Controls whether rounding operations can be relaxed to trade correctness for improved resource utilization.

[options="header"]
[width="80%"]
[cols="15%,20%,65%"]
|====
| Value ^| Mode           ^| Behavior
| 0      | CORRECT_INTEL   | Conform to the rounding mode specified by the instruction's rounding mode operand.  
| 1      | FAITHFUL_INTEL  | Allow some tolerance for error (within 1ULP of the infinitely precise result) for rounding. +
The returned result is one of the two floating point values closest to the mathematical result.

This mode is useful for devices that can trade CORRECT_INTEL rounding for improved resource utilization.

11+<|*OpArbitraryFloatPowNINTEL* +

Two *OpTypeInt* values representing an arbitrary precision floating point number and an arbitrary precision integer number of signedness _SignOfB_ are passed in as _A_ and _B_ respectively.
The value of `A^B` is returned in _Result_ where `B` is a signed or unsigned integer of arbitrary size.

_Result Type_ must be *OpTypeInt*.

_Result_ is the <id> of the operation's result, which is an arbitrary precision floating point number.

_Mresult_ and _Ma_ are 32-bit unsigned integers that define the mantissa widths of the floating point types within _Result_ and _A_ respectively.
Note that the exponent values (Ea, Eresult) are inferred from the width of the *OpTypeInt*.

_SignOfB_ specifies whether _B_ is signed or unsigned.

_Subnormal_ is a SubnormalMode chosen from _Table 3.16a_ that specifies whether subnormal numbers should be supported or flushed to zero before and after the operation.

_Rounding_ is a RoundingMode chosen from _Table 3.16_ that controls the rounding mode for the result. It is ignored if the _Accuracy_ operand is set to "FAITHFUL_INTEL".

_Accuracy_ is a RoundingAccuracy chosen from _Table 3.16d_ that controls the rounding accuracy of the result.
